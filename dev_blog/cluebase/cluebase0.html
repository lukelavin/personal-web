            <hr>
            <div markdown="1" class="blog-content">

                <p>It&#39;s been about 5 years since I created <a href="http://cluebase.lukelav.in">Cluebase</a>, a
                    general-use API for retrieving <i>Jeopardy!</i> data of all sorts--clues, episodes, contestants, and
                    more. Since then, I&#39;ve received more questions, requests, and even success stories (<a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKN-SKdbYWo">Congrats, Kate!</a>) than I could have ever
                    expected. I'm always impressed by the internet's ability to help even the most niche projects find
                    their target audience. Thank you to everyone who ever tried it out!</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, Cluebase's usefulness was at times <i>in spite</i> of its own quality (or lack
                    thereof).
                    Since its creation, it has been limited by oversights, incompleteness, and just plain bugs.
                    Cluebase&#39;s primary purpose was not to be a quality API, or to be useful for general-public
                    consumer application but
                    rather to help me gain some practical software engineering experience during a college summer
                    where I had no internship.</p>

                <p>Now, years later with a fresh
                    set of eyes and professional
                    experience in data engineering, I'm going to attempt to rebuild Cluebase from the ground-up,
                    to hopefully learn some do's and don'ts and give the project the love it deserves. </p>



                <h2>A vision for Cluebase 2.0</h2>

                <p>Part of what hindered Cluebase's development was this lack of direction and committment. It was just
                    a toy project for practice.
                    At some point, I had an idea of using Cluebase after its creation to build a
                    Jeopardy! practice app. Conveniently, the prospect of developing of this higher-level consumer would
                    provide an opportunity for me to revisit Cluebase and
                    soften its rough edges. This turned a lot of "I should do this better" moments into "I'll save that
                    for later" moments.
                    Then, for one reason or another, that follow-up project fell by the wayside, leaving Cluebase
                    without any updates or improvements since its release. </p>

                <p>If Cluebase was held back by its lack of direction, then it makes sense to start "Cluebase 2.0" with
                    an examination of what exactly it should accomplish:</p>

                <p>Ideally, Cluebase is useful as a source-of-truth for Jeopardy data. For simplicity, <b>clue data
                        should
                        be the focus of cluebase.</b> If supplementary data like episode and contestants are to be
                    accessible at
                    all, they should be only where it doesn't complicate maintaining good clue data.</p>

                <p>
                    <b>Maintenance of Cluebase should be simple.</b>
                    It is likely that this project could fall to
                    the wayside for years yet again. The project needs to be positioned to need little intervention and,
                    in the case of necessary intervention, to be easy to jump back into at any moment.
                    Infrastructure setup should be scripted/containerized
                    where possible. Design should be documented (more simply than a wordy blog post &#128566). All
                    processes should have robust error handling and recovery. Ingestion and transformation of new data
                    should be automated, transparent, and modular--when working properly it should be
                    hands off, and when it fails it should be easy to pick back up at the point of failure. APIs should
                    be versioned so changes can be deployed without breaking consumer services. Code should be
                    open-source for committed users to maintain Cluebase for their own personal use in my absence.
                </p>

                <p>The primary application of Cluebase should be retrieving clues by category and or by difficulty.
                    <b>Clients (human users or other services) should be able to easily use Cluebase to get clues for
                        targeted research or practice. Additional</b>, client-tailored applications of the clue data are
                    to be
                    expected, but should be handled as a secondary data layer on top of the base level clue data, with
                    processes and concerns separate from the base data processing. The base Cluebase processing should,
                    however, do its best to not complicate such processes.
                </p>

                <p><b>Cluebase should also be capable of providing data in the right format and quantity useful for
                        training/tuning natural language models, or doing other machine-learning-tailored tasks.</b>
                    Jeopardy's
                    hundreds of thousands of question/answer pairs should be made useful even beyond the scope of trivia
                    games. </p>
